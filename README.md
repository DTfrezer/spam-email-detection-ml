# Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project classifies email or message text as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)**
using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
To automatically detect unwanted spam messages based on textual patterns
and help users filter irrelevant or harmful content.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLP (TF-IDF Vectorization)
- Google Colab

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow
1. Text data preprocessing
2. Feature extraction using TF-IDF
3. Train-test split
4. Model training using Naive Bayes classifier
5. Model evaluation using accuracy score

## 📊 Sample Predictions

Input:
- "Congratulations! You have won a free prize. Click now"

Output:
- Spam

Input:
- "Please send the project update by evening"

Output:
- Not Spam (Ham)

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of supervised learning and classification
- Hands-on experience with NLP techniques
- Practical use of TF-IDF and Naive Bayes algorithm
